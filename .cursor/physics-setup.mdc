- Use Cannon-es for all physics simulations.
- Clearly define physics world settings (gravity, friction, restitution).
- Ensure physics and rendering update loops are synchronized.
- Always use simple collision shapes (spheres, boxes, cylinders, heightfields) for maximum performance.
- Clearly comment and document any physics-based functions (e.g., impulse application, collision responses).
