- Gameplay interactions will use a "drag-to-charge" input mechanic for shots (think pool cue pulling).
- Clearly separate game logic (shot counting, scoring, turn management) from rendering/physics code.
- Implement clear, reusable functions for handling input, game state updates, and UI interactions.
- Structure code clearly for future addition of new obstacles, holes, and gameplay features.
- Always anticipate simplicity for quick play sessions by busy adults.
