Game Design Document (GDD)

1. Game Concept

Title: [To Be Determined]

Genre: Casual Sports (Mini-Golf) ￼

Platform: Web-based (Desktop Browsers)

Overview: A minimalist, environment-focused mini-golf game emphasizing intuitive controls and realistic physics. Players engage in short sessions, navigating through a blend of realistic and quirky courses, aiming for the best score.

2. Gameplay Mechanics
	•	Core Gameplay: Players putt mini-golf balls across various courses, aiming to complete each hole in as few strokes as possible.
	•	Controls: Drag-and-release mechanism to set shot direction and power. The length of the drag indicates shot power, with a visual direction line aiding aim. ￼
	•	Scoring System: Standard golf scoring: Pars, Birdies (-1), Bogeys (+1), etc.
	•	Session Length: Designed for 10-15 minute play sessions.

3. Player Experience
	•	Difficulty: Single, relaxed setting suitable for casual play. ￼
	•	Customization: Minimal; players use a basic putter with no character representation to maintain a clean UI. ￼

4. Levels and Environment
	•	Design Aesthetic: A mix of realistic mini-golf courses with standard quirks, providing both familiarity and novelty.
	•	Obstacles: Incorporation of hazards such as sand traps, water features, and hills to challenge players.
	•	Dynamic Elements: Initial focus on stationary obstacles to fine-tune physics; potential for dynamic obstacles in future updates.

5. User Interface (UI)
	•	Design Philosophy: Sleek and non-intrusive, emphasizing the environment.
	•	Elements:
	•	Power Indicator: Visual direction line that grows with drag length to indicate shot power.
	•	Score Display: Minimalistic scoreboard, subtly integrated into the UI.

6. Audio and Visuals
	•	Audio:
	•	Music: None in the initial MVP. ￼
	•	Sound Effects: Realistic sounds for ball interactions, such as rolling and collisions.
	•	Visual Style: A balanced aesthetic between cartoonish and realistic graphics, ensuring broad appeal. ￼

7. Technical Specifications
	•	Technology Stack:
	•	Rendering Engine: Three.js
	•	Physics Engine: Cannon-es ￼
	•	Deployment: Web-based, optimized for desktop browsers.
	•	Accessibility: Standard features; no special accessibility options in the initial MVP.
	•	Settings: Simplified settings with potential debug options as needed.

8. Future Considerations
	•	Expansion: Potential to scale up to a full golf game with full swing mechanics.
	•	Dynamic Obstacles: Introduction of moving or interactive obstacles in future updates.
