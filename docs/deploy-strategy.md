# Mini Golf Break - Deployment Strategy

**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025

## Overview

Mini Golf Break is a premium space-themed mini-golf game built with Three.js and Cannon-es physics. This document outlines the deployment strategy for delivering a high-performance gaming experience across web platforms.

## Core Requirements

### Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Three.js 0.174.0, Cannon-es 0.20.0
- **Build System:** Webpack 5 with optimized chunking
- **Testing:** Jest (82.76% coverage) + Playwright
- **Current Build Size:** ~1.34MB optimized

### Platform Requirements
- **Desktop Browsers:** Chrome 90+, Firefox 88+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Mobile Browsers:** iOS Safari 14+, Chrome Android 90+
- **Performance Target:** 60 FPS on modern devices, 30 FPS minimum
- **Load Time:** < 3 seconds on 4G networks

## Build Configuration

### Development Build
```bash
npm start
```
- Source maps enabled for debugging
- Hot module replacement (HMR)
- Performance monitoring overlay
- Debug logging enabled
- Unminified code for readability

### Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```
- Code minification with Terser
- Tree shaking for unused code removal
- Asset optimization (textures, models)
- Chunk splitting (Three.js, Cannon-es, app code)
- Gzip/Brotli compression ready

### Current Build Output
```
Asset                  Size        Chunks
main.js               361 KiB      [main]
three.js              901 KiB      [three]
cannon.js             121 KiB      [cannon]
vendors.js            11.4 KiB     [vendors]
runtime.js            1.24 KiB     [runtime]
Total:                1.36 MiB
```

## Deployment Pipeline

### 1. Pre-commit Validation
Automated checks before code commit:
- Prettier formatting validation
- ESLint code quality checks
- Security audit (npm audit)
- Build validation (dev + prod)
- Unit test execution with coverage

### 2. CI/CD Pipeline
GitHub Actions workflow:
```yaml
- Install dependencies
- Run unit tests (82.76% coverage)
- Run integration tests
- Build production bundle
- Run UAT tests (Playwright)
- Deploy to staging
```

### 3. Staging Environment
- Full production build deployed
- Performance profiling enabled
- Error tracking activated
- A/B testing capabilities
- User feedback collection

### 4. Production Deployment
- CDN deployment (CloudFlare/AWS)
- Asset versioning with cache busting
- Progressive enhancement
- Graceful degradation for older devices

## Performance Optimization

### Asset Strategy
1. **Texture Optimization**
   - Multiple resolutions (512px, 1024px, 2048px)
   - WebP format with JPEG fallback
   - Lazy loading for non-critical textures
   - Texture atlasing for UI elements

2. **Code Splitting**
   ```javascript
   // Webpack configuration
   optimization: {
     splitChunks: {
       chunks: 'all',
       cacheGroups: {
         three: {
           test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]three/,
           name: 'three',
           priority: 10
         },
         cannon: {
           test: /[\\/]node_modules[\\/]cannon-es/,
           name: 'cannon',
           priority: 10
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Quality Scaling**
   - Low: Mobile devices, integrated graphics
   - Medium: Standard desktop, recent mobile
   - High: Gaming PCs, high-end devices

### Loading Strategy
1. **Critical Path**
   - Inline critical CSS
   - Preload essential assets
   - Async load non-critical resources

2. **Progressive Loading**
   ```javascript
   // Phase 1: Core game engine
   // Phase 2: Course data and textures
   // Phase 3: Visual effects and enhancements
   // Phase 4: Audio and optional features
   ```

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Monitoring
Built-in PerformanceManager tracks:
- FPS (target: 60, minimum: 30)
- Frame time (target: <16.67ms)
- Memory usage (target: <500MB)
- Physics step time
- Render time

### Error Tracking
- Sentry integration for production errors
- Custom error boundaries
- Detailed error context
- User session replay capability

### Analytics
- Google Analytics 4 for user behavior
- Custom events for game actions
- Performance metrics collection
- A/B testing framework

## Security Considerations

### Content Security Policy
```
Content-Security-Policy: 
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://www.googletagmanager.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' data: https:;
  connect-src 'self' https://api.minigolfbreak.com;
```

### Best Practices
- Input validation for all user actions
- XSS prevention in dynamic content
- Secure asset loading (HTTPS only)
- Regular dependency updates
- Security headers implementation
