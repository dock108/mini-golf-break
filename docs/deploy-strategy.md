# Offline Deployment Strategy Document for Mini Golf Break

This document outlines the deployment strategy for **Mini Golf Break**, initially as a web application with progressive offline capabilities, ensuring smooth, accessible, and performant user experiences.

## 1. Offline Requirements

- **Gameplay Connectivity:** Initially, the game will require internet connectivity for initial loading but will feature single-player gameplay without multiplayer requirements.
- **Future Offline Capability:** Eventual expansion to full offline capabilities, potentially utilizing technologies like Progressive Web Apps (PWA) or Electron for desktop deployment.

## 2. Deployment Platform

- **Initial Platform:** Deploy to Vercel, providing easy and scalable initial access for users.
- **Long-term Vision:** Plan to eventually extend deployment to fully offline-capable platforms like PWAs or Electron, enhancing accessibility and user convenience.

## 3. Caching and Storage

- **Browser Caching:** Heavily leverage browser caching and local storage to improve load times and performance for returning players.
- **Local Storage:** No immediate storage of game progress or scores locally in the initial MVP; however, this may be revisited in future updates.

## 4. Updates & Maintenance

- **Update Checks:** The game will not automatically check for updates or force mandatory updates at launch, simplifying initial deployment and user experience.

## 5. Loading & Performance

- **Asset Loading:** Minimize initial loading times by progressively loading assets per level or as needed, rather than preloading all assets upfront.
- **Performance Priority:** Maintain high-performance standards, ensuring quick and smooth gameplay experiences.

## 6. Progressive Enhancement

- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** Future consideration for converting the game into a fully offline PWA, providing reliable performance and offline access for users.

## Best Practices

- Regularly test caching and asset loading strategies across various browsers and conditions.
- Monitor and optimize performance consistently to maintain quick load times and smooth gameplay.
- Prepare the infrastructure and assets in a modular way to facilitate future offline or PWA transitions smoothly.

This deployment strategy ensures Mini Golf Break delivers consistent, accessible, and enjoyable gameplay while preparing the groundwork for future offline enhancements.
