## Architecture Overview

Mini Golf Break follows a component-based architecture where different systems interact primarily through an `EventManager`. The main components are coordinated by the `Game` class. The system heavily relies on manager classes, each handling a specific domain.

### Core Manager Responsibilities:
*   **`EventManager`**: Central hub for publishing and subscribing to game events. Decouples managers.
*   **`GameLoopManager`**: Orchestrates the main game update loop, calling manager updates in the correct order (`physics` -> `game logic` -> `rendering/camera`).
*   **`StateManager`**: Manages the overall game state (Initializing, Aiming, Ball Moving, Hole Completed, Game Completed, Ad Inspecting).
*   **`Game` (`Game.js`)**: Top-level coordinator. Initializes all managers, sets up the core Three.js scene/renderer/lights, handles window resize, and orchestrates cleanup.
*   **`PhysicsManager`**: Manages the Cannon-es physics world, materials, and simulation step. Delegates world creation to `PhysicsWorld`.
*   **`UIManager`**: Manages all DOM-based UI elements. Delegates specific UI areas (Score/Hole Info, Debug Info) to submodules (`UIScoreOverlay`, `UIDebugOverlay`). Handles messages and power indicator directly.
*   **`DebugManager`**: Handles debug state, logging, error reporting. Delegates UI overlays (Error, Course Debug) to submodules (`DebugErrorOverlay`, `DebugCourseUI`). Manages 3D debug helpers (axes, grid).
*   **`CameraController`**: Handles camera positioning (high-angle overview, aiming view, active ball following), movement, transitions, user adjustments, and subtle ad focus blending.
*   **`InputController`**: Manages user input (mouse/touch) for aiming and hitting the ball. Also handles key presses for debug toggles (delegating to `DebugManager`) and Ad Inspect mode ('i'), and raycasting for ad banner clicks.
*   **`BallManager`**: Manages the creation, state, physics updates, and removal of the golf ball (`Ball.js`).
*   **`CourseManager` (`NineHoleCourse` / `BasicCourse`)**: Handles course generation, layout, and hole configurations. `NineHoleCourse` manages the 9-hole structure.
*   **`HoleEntity`**: Represents a single hole's geometry, physics elements, and hazards. Instantiated by the `CourseManager`.
*   **`HazardManager`**: Detects when the ball enters hazards (out of bounds, water) and triggers resets/penalties via events.
*   **`HoleCompletionManager`**: Handles logic when the ball enters the hole (`BALL_IN_HOLE` event). Triggers effects, sound, UI messages, updates score, sets state, and initiates hole transitions or game completion via events.
*   **`HoleTransitionManager`**: Manages the transition sequence between holes (cleanup, setup, camera/ball positioning).
*   **`ScoringSystem`**: Tracks strokes per hole and total strokes.
*   **`AudioManager`**: Handles sound playback using Three.js Audio.
*   **`AdShipManager`**: Manages the lifecycle, movement, ad display, collision avoidance, and interaction for `AdShip` instances. Hooks into the scene graph and update loop.
*   **`PerformanceManager`**: Tracks FPS, frame times, and component update times.
*   **`VisualEffectsManager`**: Intended for managing visual effects (currently minimal usage).

### System Interactions:
*   **Scene Graph**: `Game` owns the main `THREE.Scene`. Managers like `CourseManager`, `BallManager`, `AdShipManager`, and `DebugManager` add their respective `THREE.Group` or `THREE.Mesh` objects to this scene. `HoleEntity` adds its components to a group managed by the `CourseManager`.
*   **Update Loop (`GameLoopManager`)**: Calls the `update(deltaTime)` method on relevant managers in a specific order (e.g., Physics -> Ball -> Course -> Ads -> Camera -> UI -> Debug).
*   **Event Manager**: Most cross-manager communication uses events (e.g., `BALL_HIT`, `HOLE_COMPLETED`, `HAZARD_DETECTED`, `STATE_CHANGED`). Managers subscribe to events they care about and publish events when significant actions occur.
*   **Direct References**: Some managers hold references to others (often passed via constructor or `init`), e.g., `UIManager` references `ScoringSystem`, `DebugManager` references `Game` to access other managers or the scene. This is minimized in favor of events.

## Core Systems

### Physics System
- Uses Cannon-es via `PhysicsManager` and `PhysicsWorld`.
- Ball properties:
  - Mass: 0.45kg
  - Linear damping: 0.6
  - Angular damping: 0.6
- World configuration:
  - Gravity: -9.81 m/s²
  - Solver iterations: 10 (Adjusted)
  - Max substeps: 3 (Adjusted)
  - Fixed timestep: 1/60 second
- See `docs/technical/physics-parameters.md` for detailed material and contact properties.

#### Physics Gameplay Goals (from physics-specs.md)

*   **Ball Movement**: Aim for realistic rolling, proper friction/damping, and intuitive response to applied force. Ball should come to a complete stop reliably.
*   **Course Interactions**: Different surfaces (green, sand) should noticeably affect ball speed and behavior. Collisions with walls/obstacles should feel fair.
*   **Hole Mechanics**: Hole detection should be reliable based on proximity and low speed. Visual/audio feedback for success should be clear.

### Rendering and Visuals
- Three.js for 3D rendering managed by the `Game` class.
- **Course Geometry**: Uses Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) via `three-csg-ts` in `HoleEntity.js` to create cutouts for the hole and sand traps in the green surface, avoiding Z-fighting.
- **Starfield**: Procedurally generated starfield background in `Game.js`.
- **Lighting**: Basic ambient and directional lighting in `Game.js`.
- **Effects**: Ball glow, success particles (`Ball.js`), hole fade-out (`HoleCompletionManager`).
- **Style Guide**: Aims for a clean, minimalist, high-contrast look. Emissive materials used for visibility (e.g., green fairway). Key colors: Green (fairway), White (ball), Dark (hole rim), Accent (UI elements). See `graphics-and-style-guide.md` for specific color codes if needed (Consider merging fully or deleting this file).

### Input System
- Managed by `InputController`.
- **Core Mechanic**: Drag-and-release mouse/touch input.
    - Click/touch and drag to aim (determines direction).
    - Drag distance determines power (linear scaling, clamped).
    - Release to shoot.
- **Visual Feedback**:
    - Aim direction line displayed during drag.
    - Power indicator (likely DOM element) shows shot strength during drag.
- **State Handling**: Input is disabled by `InputController` during ball movement, hole transitions, and potentially UI interactions based on events like `BALL_STOPPED`, `HOLE_STARTED`, `BALL_IN_HOLE`.
- Integrates with `CameraController` to disable orbit controls during aiming/dragging.

### Performance Monitoring System
- Managed by `PerformanceManager`.
- Tracks FPS, frame times, component update times, memory usage, and object counts.
- Press 'p' key during gameplay to toggle the visual performance display overlay.
- Display shows real-time metrics, often color-coded based on performance budgets (e.g., FPS target > 30).
- Provides warnings via `DebugManager` when budgets are exceeded.

## Game Flow

1.  **Initialization (`main.js` -> `Game.init`)**:
    *   `Game` creates and initializes all managers in dependency order.
    *   `UIManager` creates the main UI container and initializes submodules (`UIScoreOverlay`, `UIDebugOverlay`).
    *   `DebugManager` initializes submodules (`DebugErrorOverlay`, `DebugCourseUI`).
    *   `PhysicsManager` initializes `PhysicsWorld`.
    *   `AdShipManager` spawns initial ships and adds its group to the scene.
    *   `Game.createCourse()` called, which instantiates `NineHoleCourse`.
    *   `NineHoleCourse.create()` initializes hole groups, calls `initializeHole(0)`.
    *   `NineHoleCourse.initializeHole()` creates `HoleEntity` for Hole 1, placing it in `Hole_1_Group`.
    *   `BallManager.createBall()` places the ball at the hole's start position.
    *   `CameraController` positions the camera for the first hole.
    *   `StateManager` sets state to `AIMING`.
    *   `GameLoopManager` starts the main loop.
2.  **Aiming (`GameState.AIMING`)**: Player uses drag input (`InputController`).
3.  **Ball Hit**: `InputController` -> `BallManager.hitBall` -> `Ball.applyForce` -> `EventManager.publish(BALL_HIT)`. `StateManager` sets state to `BALL_MOVING`.
4.  **Ball Moving (`GameState.BALL_MOVING`)**:
    *   `GameLoopManager.update()` calls managers.
    *   `PhysicsManager.update()` steps the physics world.
    *   `BallManager.update()` updates ball position from physics body. Publishes `BALL_MOVED`.
    *   `AdShipManager.update()` moves ships, handles collisions/recycling.
    *   `CameraController.update()` actively follows the ball, potentially blending towards ad ships.
    *   `HazardManager.update()` checks ball position against hazards.
    *   `UIManager` (via `UIDebugOverlay`) updates debug info display.
5.  **Ball Stops**: `BallManager` detects low velocity -> `EventManager.publish(BALL_STOPPED)`. `StateManager` sets state to `AIMING`. `InputController` re-enables aiming.
6.  **Hazard**: `HazardManager` detects hazard -> `EventManager.publish(HAZARD_DETECTED, { type: 'water'|'oob' })`. `BallManager` subscribes, resets ball to last safe position, calls `ScoringSystem.addStroke()`. `UIManager` subscribes, shows penalty message.
7.  **Ball in Hole**: `Ball.update()` detects proximity/speed condition -> `EventManager.publish(BALL_IN_HOLE)`. `HoleCompletionManager` subscribes:
    *   Plays sound/effects via `AudioManager`/`Ball`. Shows UI message via `UIManager`.
    *   Sets `StateManager.setHoleCompleted(true)` (which sets state to `HOLE_COMPLETED`).
    *   Updates score via `ScoringSystem`.
    *   Publishes `HOLE_COMPLETED` event (includes hole number, strokes). `UIManager` subscribes to update score/stroke display.
    *   Checks if last hole (`StateManager.getCurrentHoleNumber()` vs `Course.getTotalHoles()`).
    *   If last hole -> `StateManager.setGameState(GAME_COMPLETED)`. Publishes `GAME_COMPLETED`.
    *   If not last hole -> Calls `HoleTransitionManager.transitionToNextHole()` after delay.
8.  **Hole Transition (`HoleTransitionManager`)**:
    *   Cleans previous hole (`NineHoleCourse.clearCurrentHole()` -> `HoleEntity.destroy()`).
    *   Initializes next hole (`NineHoleCourse.initializeHole(nextIndex)` -> creates new `HoleEntity`).
    *   Resets ball position via `BallManager`.
    *   Updates camera via `CameraController`.
    *   Updates UI via `UIManager` (triggered by `HOLE_STARTED` event published by `StateManager.resetForNextHole`).
    *   `StateManager.resetForNextHole()` sets state back to `AIMING`.
9.  **Game Complete (`GameState.GAME_COMPLETED`)**: `UIManager` subscribes to `GAME_COMPLETED`, calls `UIScoreOverlay.showFinalScorecard()`. Scorecard buttons publish `UI_REQUEST_MAIN_MENU` or `UI_REQUEST_RESTART_GAME`.
10. **Ad Inspecting (`GameState.AD_INSPECTING`)**: Toggled via 'i' key (`InputController`). `CameraController` enables orbit controls. `InputController` enables raycasting for banner clicks. Clicking banner opens `adData.url`. Toggling off returns state to `AIMING`.

## Key Classes and Responsibilities

*   **`Game` (`src/scenes/Game.js`)**: Main coordinator. Initializes systems, manages core Three.js objects (scene, renderer, lights), sets up starfield, handles window resize, and orchestrates cleanup. Most direct game logic has been moved to managers.
    - Manages restart functionality
    - Instantiates and cleans up major managers, including `AdShipManager`.
*   **`NineHoleCourse` (`src/objects/NineHoleCourse.js`)**: Defines the 9-hole structure. Loads hole configurations from an internal array, initializes `HoleEntity` objects placing them within pre-defined `THREE.Group` containers (`holeGroups`), manages transitions between holes by calling `initializeHole` and `clearCurrentHole`. See [Nine-Hole Course Status](#nine-hole-course-status) below.
*   **`HoleEntity` (`src/objects/HoleEntity.js`)**: Represents a single hole. Creates the green surface (using CSG), walls, hole trigger, start marker, and hazards (sand traps using CSG) based on configuration. Manages associated meshes and physics bodies.
*   **`Ball` (`src/objects/Ball.js`)**: Represents the player's ball.
    *   **Core**: Creates the visual mesh (THREE.Mesh) and physics body (CANNON.Body).
    *   **Physics**: Handles physics updates, applying damping and sleep states. Provides methods `applyForce()`/`applyImpulse()` to hit the ball, `setPosition()`, `resetVelocity()`.
    *   **Collision**: Listens for physics collisions, specifically checking for the hole trigger body (`userData.type === 'hole'`).
    *   **Events**: Publishes `BALL_IN_HOLE` upon successful hole collision.
    *   **Effects**: Manages its own visual effects like glow and `handleHoleSuccess()` (triggers particles, sound via `AudioManager`).
    *   **Cleanup**: `cleanup()` method disposes of mesh, body, geometry, material.
*   **`UIManager` (`src/managers/UIManager.js`)**: Manages all DOM elements: score display, hole info, stroke count, messages, power indicator (styling likely inline), debug info (styling likely inline), and the final scorecard overlay.
*   **`InputController` (`src/controls/InputController.js`)**: Handles mouse/touch input for aiming/hitting, calculates shot vector, manages aim/power indicators, disables/enables input based on game state.
    - Handles ad banner clicks via raycasting when in `AD_INSPECTING` state.
    - Toggles `AD_INSPECTING` state via key press ('i').
*   **`CameraController` (`src/controls/CameraController.js`)**:
    *   **Core**: Manages the Three.js `PerspectiveCamera`.
    *   **Intelligent Positioning**: Positions the camera with a high overhead angle that shows the entire hole and ensures enough space behind the ball for pull-back aiming.
    *   **User Adjustments**: Detects when the player manually adjusts the camera and respects these adjustments until the ball moves.
    *   **Active Following**: Actively follows the ball's motion by positioning the camera behind the movement direction, not just changing the orbit center.
    *   **Dynamic Following**: When the ball is moving fast, the camera positions itself behind the movement direction; when slow or stopped, it maintains a consistent position relative to the ball.
    *   **Offset Viewport**: Camera is intentionally shifted down by approximately 15% to show more of the course at the top of the screen and less starfield at the bottom.
    *   **Transitions**: Improved transitions with the camera intelligently following behind the ball's movement direction with increased responsiveness.
    *   **Orbit Controls**: Integrates `OrbitControls` for free look when the player is not aiming/hitting.
    *   **Initialization**: Sets initial camera position with a high angle and good framing of the course.
    *   **Cleanup**: Disposes of controls and event listeners.
    - Respects user camera adjustments until the ball moves again
    - Subtly blends camera target towards nearest ad ship while the ball is in motion.
    - Resets ad focus blend state when positioning for a new hole.
*   **`ScoringSystem` (`src/game/ScoringSystem.js`)**: Simple system to track strokes per hole and total strokes for the course.
*   **`HoleCompletionManager` (`src/managers/HoleCompletionManager.js`)**: Central handler for the `BALL_IN_HOLE` event. Triggers effects, sound, UI messages, updates score, sets state, and initiates hole transitions or game completion.
*   **`AdShipManager` (`src/ads/AdShipManager.js`)**: Manages the ad ship system.
    -   **Scene Graph**: Adds its main `THREE.Group` (`AdShipManager.group`) to the main `Game.scene`.
    -   **Update Loop**: `update(deltaTime)` method called by `GameLoopManager`. Moves ships, handles simple N^2 collision avoidance (with `distanceToSquared` optimization), recycles linear ships, rotates ads based on timers.
    -   **Communication**: Instantiated by `Game`. `CameraController` may query it for ship positions. `InputController` interacts via raycasting against `AdShip` banner meshes.
    -   **Configuration**: `maxShips` (currently 4 due to O(N^2) collision), movement parameters defined internally.
*   **`AdShip` (`src/ads/AdShip.js`)**: Represents a single ad ship instance.
    -   **Scene Graph**: Creates its own `THREE.Group` containing body mesh and banner mesh. This group is added to the `AdShipManager.group`.
    -   **Update Loop**: `update(deltaTime)` method called by `AdShipManager`, currently only used for station rotation animation.
    -   **Communication**: Instantiated by `AdShipManager`. `AdShipManager` calls `updateAd()` to change texture. `InputController` raycasts against its `bannerMesh`.
    -   Generates dynamic canvas textures. Stores `adData` in `bannerMesh.userData`.
*   **`adConfig` (`src/ads/adConfig.js`)**: Exports a `mockAds` array containing ad objects (`{ title, url, texturePath }`).
    - `texturePath` is currently unused as banners are canvas-generated.

## Nine-Hole Course Status

*(As of 2025-04-06)*

The `NineHoleCourse.js` system provides the foundation for a full 9-hole game.

*   **Structure**: It pre-creates 9 `THREE.Group` containers (e.g., `Hole_1_Group`, `Hole_2_Group`, etc.) which are permanently added to the main scene. When a hole is loaded (`initializeHole`), a `HoleEntity` is created and its contents are added to the corresponding group. When a hole is cleared (`clearCurrentHole`), the `HoleEntity`'s contents are destroyed, but the parent group remains.
*   **Hole Configurations**: Hole layouts (positions, hazards, bumpers, par, description) are currently defined within a large array (`this.holeConfigs`) inside the `NineHoleCourse.js` constructor.
*   **Current Status**:
    *   **Holes 1-9**: All 9 hole configurations *exist* in the `holeConfigs` array. These define starting positions, hole positions, basic dimensions, pars, descriptions, and some hazard/bumper layouts.
    *   **Completeness**: These configurations are functional and should load correctly via `HoleEntity`. They represent a complete 9-hole course in terms of data.
    *   **Geometry**: The geometry (green shape, walls, hazards, bumpers) is generated procedurally by `HoleEntity` based on the configuration data. There is no placeholder geometry remaining.
*   **Future Plans**:
    *   **Configuration**: Ideally, the `holeConfigs` array should be moved out of the constructor into a separate JSON file (e.g., `src/config/nineHoleLayout.json`) to make editing easier.
    *   **Hazards/Bumpers**: More complex hazard types (e.g., moving obstacles, different trigger effects) or dynamic bumper interactions could be added by extending `HazardFactory.js` or adding new logic to `HoleEntity.js`. No specific complex hazards are planned *imminently* but the system is extensible.

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up
1.  Clone repo: `git clone ...`
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Start dev server: `npm start`

### Making Changes
- Identify the responsible manager(s) for the feature.
- Modify manager logic and utilize the `EventManager` for cross-component communication.
- Add/modify UI elements via `UIManager`.
- Add/modify 3D objects via `HoleEntity`, `Ball`, or `Game`.
- Update relevant documentation.

### Debugging
*   Press 'd' to toggle `DebugManager` features (3D helpers, course debug UI).
*   Press 'p' to toggle `PerformanceManager` overlay.
*   Use browser developer console for extensive logs.
*   **Ad Inspect Mode:** Press 'i' key when ball stopped to toggle. Enables orbit controls and ad clicking.

## Testing and Debugging

### Debug Mode
Press 'd' during gameplay to toggle debug mode, which:
- Shows axes helpers and grid
- Displays additional console logs
- Shows a wireframe view of the scene (TBD, might conflict with physics debugger)

## Physics Debug Renderer

The project includes `CannonDebugRenderer` (from `src/utils/CannonDebugRenderer.js`) to help visualize the Cannon.js physics bodies directly within the Three.js scene. This is invaluable for debugging collision issues.

- **Integration**: It's initialized in `Game.js` and updated in `GameLoopManager.js` before rendering.
- **Appearance**: It draws green wireframes around all active physics bodies.
- **Usage**: If collisions aren't working as expected (e.g., ball falling through floor), enable this view to see if the physics bodies are correctly positioned, oriented, and shaped.

## Common Issues & Checks
1.  **Physics**: Collision groups/masks, material properties, body positioning, sleep states, damping.
2.  **Visuals**: Camera position/target, object positions, Z-fighting (CSG helps), material transparency/opacity, lighting/shadows.
3.  **State/Flow**: Event publishing/subscriptions, manager initialization order (`Game.init`), state transitions (`StateManager`), race conditions during transitions.
4.  **CSG Issues**: Ensure correct geometry subtraction order, apply matrix transforms *before* CSG conversion, recalculate normals (`computeVertexNormals`) on the final mesh.

## Physics Implementation

The physics system uses Cannon-es with these key configurations:

1.  **Course Geometry**:
    -   Uses a `CANNON.Trimesh` generated directly from the visual `THREE.PlaneGeometry` for the floor.
    -   Floor bodies are correctly set to `type: CANNON.Body.STATIC`.
    -   Hole cutouts using CSG are currently disabled; hole interaction is handled separately.

2.  **Hole Interaction**:
    -   Hole detection logic resides entirely within `Ball.update()`.
    -   It checks if the ball's center is within a defined `holePhysicalRadius` of the hole's center position (`ball.currentHolePosition`).
    -   If close enough, it checks the ball's speed against `ball.holeEntryThresholds.MAX_SAFE_SPEED`.
    -   If faster than safe speed, it calculates the impact angle using `calculateImpactAngle` and checks for lip-out conditions using `isLipOut` (based on speed/angle thresholds).
    -   A static cylinder trigger body (`holeTriggerBody`) exists at the hole location but is currently unused for detection logic (could be removed or used for visual debugging).
    -   The physical `holeCupBody` has been removed.

3.  **Collision Groups**:
    -   Group 1: Course terrain (Floor/Green - Trimesh)
    -   Group 2: Holes and triggers (Unused holeTrigger body)
    -   Group 4: Ball
    -   Group 8: Triggers (e.g., Bunker Zones)

4.  **Material Properties**:
    -   `groundMaterial`: High friction (0.8) for realistic rolling. Used for the green Trimesh.
    -   `ballMaterial`: For the player's ball.
    -   `bumperMaterial`: Low friction (0.1) with high restitution (0.8). Used for course walls.
    -   `holeRimMaterial`: Currently unused.
    -   `holeCupMaterial`: Removed.

5.  **Ball Physics**:
    -   Mass: 0.45 kg
    -   Linear/Angular Damping: 0.6
    -   Sleep parameters configured.
    -   Hole entry thresholds defined in constructor (`MAX_SAFE_SPEED`, `LIP_OUT_SPEED_THRESHOLD`, `LIP_OUT_ANGLE_THRESHOLD`).

6.  **Physics World Settings**:
    -   Gravity: -9.81 m/s²
    -   Solver Iterations: 30
    -   Fixed Timestep: 1/60s

## Debug Mode

Press 'd' during gameplay to toggle debug mode, which shows:
- Axes helpers and grid helpers (via `DebugManager`).
- Physics wireframes (via `CannonDebugRenderer`, controlled by `DebugManager` state).

## Physics Debug Renderer

The project includes `CannonDebugRenderer` (`src/utils/CannonDebugRenderer.js`) to visualize Cannon.js physics bodies.

- **Integration**: Initialized in `Game.js`. Its `update()` is called conditionally in `GameLoopManager.js` based on `DebugManager.enabled`. Its meshes are cleared by `DebugManager.toggleDebugMode()` when disabling debug mode. Its `world` reference is updated by `HoleTransitionManager` after physics world reset.
- **Appearance**: Draws green wireframes around active physics bodies.
- **Usage**: Essential for debugging collision issues, body placement, and orientation.

## Animated Scorecard Implementation

The scorecard implementation is currently a static overlay. Future updates will include an animated scorecard that shows the player's progress and highlights their best shots.

*   Assigns movement patterns (orbiting for stations, linear for others) and parameters.
*   Handles simple distance-based collision avoidance (slowdown) between ships.
*   Recycles linear ships when they go out of bounds.
*   Rotates ads displayed on ships based on timers.
*   Contains the main `THREE.Group` holding all ad ships, added to the main scene.

### AdShip Class (`src/ads/AdShip.js`)

Represents a single ad ship:
*   Creates procedural placeholder mesh based on type (nasa, alien, station).
*   Creates a `PlaneGeometry` banner mesh.
*   Generates dynamic banner textures using the Canvas API based on `adData.title`.
*   Updates its internal state (e.g., station rotation).
*   Provides an `updateAd` method to change the displayed ad and regenerate the texture.
*   Stores `adData` in banner mesh `userData` for click detection.

### AdConfig File (`src/ads/adConfig.js`)

*   Exports a `mockAds` array containing ad objects (`{ title, url, ... }`).
*   (Currently uses dummy URLs).
