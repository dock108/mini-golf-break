# Mini Golf Break - Camera Behavior Specifications

## Camera System Overview

### Core Camera Properties
- Field of View: 60 degrees
- Near Plane: 0.1 units
- Far Plane: 1000 units
- Aspect Ratio: Dynamic (based on viewport)
- Position: Behind ball looking toward hole
- Height: 2-3 units above ground
- Distance: 5-7 units from ball

### Camera States

1. **Idle State**
   - Positioned behind ball
   - Looking toward hole
   - Smooth damping for movement
   - Optional orbit controls enabled

2. **Shot State**
   - Follows ball movement
   - Maintains relative position
   - Smooth transitions
   - Disabled orbit controls

3. **Success State**
   - Focuses on hole
   - Smooth zoom to hole
   - Particle effect visibility
   - Score display visibility

4. **Transition State**
   - Smooth movement to next hole
   - Proper orientation reset
   - Disabled orbit controls
   - UI element visibility

## Camera Behaviors

### Ball Following
- Maintains relative position behind ball
- Smooth damping for movement
- Proper height and distance constraints
- Collision avoidance with obstacles
- Clear view of upcoming course

### Shot Execution
- Camera follows ball trajectory
- Maintains proper viewing angle
- Smooth acceleration/deceleration
- Clear visibility of ball movement
- Proper focus on important elements

### Hole Transitions
- Smooth movement to next hole
- Proper orientation reset
- Clear view of new hole
- Ball positioning visibility
- UI element updates

### Orbit Controls
- Enabled during idle state
- Disabled during shot execution
- Smooth damping for rotation
- Proper constraints
- Clear course visibility

## Technical Implementation

### Camera Setup
```javascript
// Camera configuration
const cameraConfig = {
    fov: 60,
    near: 0.1,
    far: 1000,
    height: 2.5,
    distance: 6,
    damping: 0.1
};
```

### Camera Movement
- Smooth interpolation
- Proper damping values
- Collision detection
- Boundary constraints
- Performance optimization

### Camera Controls
- Orbit controls during idle
- Disabled during shots
- Proper constraints
- Smooth transitions
- Clear feedback

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization
- Efficient camera updates
- Smooth transitions
- Proper cleanup
- Memory management
- Frame rate stability

### Edge Cases
- Ball out of bounds
- Camera collision
- Transition errors
- Performance issues
- Mobile viewport

## Testing Requirements

### Camera Validation
1. **Movement**
   - Smooth following
   - Proper positioning
   - Clear visibility
   - No jittering

2. **Transitions**
   - Smooth hole changes
   - Proper orientation
   - Clear view
   - No glitches

3. **Controls**
   - Responsive orbit
   - Proper constraints
   - Clear feedback
   - No errors

### Performance Metrics
