MVP Scope Document for Mini Golf Break

1. Objective

Develop a web-based mini-golf game that offers an intuitive and enjoyable experience, emphasizing realistic physics and minimalist design. The MVP will include essential features to allow players to engage in short, casual play sessions.

2. Core Features

2.1 Gameplay Mechanics
	•	Putting Mechanics: Implement a drag-and-release control system where the length of the drag determines shot power, accompanied by a visual direction line for aiming.
	•	Physics Simulation: Utilize Three.js and Cannon-es to simulate realistic ball movement, collisions, and interactions with course elements.
	•	Scoring System: Adopt standard golf scoring (e.g., Pars, Birdies, Bogeys) to track player performance.

2.2 Course Design
	•	Initial Courses: Design 3-5 unique holes that blend realistic mini-golf elements with standard quirks, incorporating hazards such as sand traps, water features, and hills.
	•	Static Obstacles: Focus on stationary obstacles to fine-tune physics and gameplay mechanics.

2.3 User Interface (UI)
	•	Minimalist Design: Ensure a clean and non-intrusive UI that highlights the environment.
	•	Essential Elements: Include a power indicator (visual direction line) and a subtle scoreboard displaying the current score.

2.4 Audio and Visuals
	•	Sound Effects: Incorporate realistic audio cues for ball interactions, such as rolling and collisions.
	•	Visual Style: Balance between cartoonish and realistic graphics to appeal to a broad audience.

3. Technical Requirements
	•	Platform: Web-based, optimized for desktop browsers.
	•	Technology Stack: Use Three.js for rendering and Cannon-es for physics simulation. ￼
	•	Deployment: Deploy the game using Vercel for efficient access and scalability.

4. User Experience
	•	Session Length: Design the game for 10-15 minute play sessions, suitable for casual engagement.
	•	Difficulty: Maintain a single, relaxed difficulty setting to ensure accessibility.
	•	Customization: Limit customization options to maintain simplicity; players will use a basic putter without character representation.

5. Future Considerations
	•	Dynamic Obstacles: Plan for the introduction of moving or interactive obstacles in future updates.
	•	Expansion: Consider scaling up to a full golf game with full swing mechanics based on user feedback and engagement.
