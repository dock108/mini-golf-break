# Architecture Standardization Checklist

This checklist helps track the implementation of our architectural standards across all components of the Mini Golf Break codebase.

## Component Status

| **Core Systems** |
| EventManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| DebugManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Managers** |
| BallManager | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| HazardManager | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| HoleManager | ❌ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| GameLoopManager | ⚠️ | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PhysicsManager | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| PerformanceManager | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ | ✅ | ⚠️ |
| AudioManager | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| UIManager | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Controllers** |
| CameraController | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| InputController | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **Game Objects** |
| Ball | ❌ | ⚠️ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

### Key:
- ✅ = Fully compliant with standards
- ⚠️ = Partially compliant, needs review
- ❌ = Not compliant, needs implementation
- 🔄 = Currently being updated

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1 (High Priority - Core Systems) ✅
- [x] EventManager
- [x] DebugManager
- [x] Game (main coordinator)
- [x] CameraController
- [x] InputController
- [x] BallManager

### Phase 2 (Medium Priority - Game Systems)
- [ ] GameLoopManager
- [ ] PhysicsManager
- [ ] HazardManager
- [ ] HoleManager
- [ ] UIManager

### Phase 3 (Lower Priority - Supporting Systems)
- [ ] AudioManager
- [ ] Ball
- [ ] Course
- [ ] Hazard 
- [ ] PerformanceManager

## Implementation Notes

For each component, ensure these standards are implemented:

### 1. Initialization Pattern
- Has `isInitialized` flag
- Implements try/catch in `init()`
- Returns `this` for chaining
- Checks for multiple initialization
- Logs initialization status

### 2. Error Handling
- Uses DebugManager for errors and warnings
- Provides proper context in error messages
- Implements graceful fallbacks
- Has appropriately placed try/catch blocks

### 3. Event Communication
- Uses EventManager for inter-component communication
- Properly stores event subscriptions
- Has clearly defined event handlers
- Follows event naming conventions

### 4. Cleanup Pattern
- Properly disposes of resources
- Cleans up event subscriptions
- Removes DOM listeners
- Disposes THREE.js objects
- Sets objects to null
- Properly marks as uninitialized
