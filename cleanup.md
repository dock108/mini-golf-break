Awesome — that’s a solid and detailed review. Here’s a step-by-step cleanup and refactor plan based on that analysis. It’s structured in phases so you can chip away at it cleanly without disrupting gameplay or new features.

Mini Golf Break – Codebase Cleanup Plan

⸻

Phase 1: Dead Code & Linting Pass

Goals:
	•	Remove legacy/stale code.
	•	Clean up unused variables, imports, and commented-out blocks.

Steps:
	1.	Sweep DebugManager.js, PhysicsManager.js, and any course files for commented-out debug blocks (e.g., CSG references, old physics debug setups).
	2.	Use ESLint or your IDE to auto-remove:
	•	Unused imports
	•	Unused variables
	3.	Confirm NineHoleCourse doesn’t reference placeholder geometry or stub holes that aren’t playable.

⸻

Phase 2: Refactor Large Files

Goals:
	•	Break down long managers into focused submodules.
	•	Improve readability and maintainability.

Steps:
	1.	UIManager.js
	•	Move score overlay into UIScoreOverlay.js
	•	Move debug UI into UIDebugOverlay.js
	•	Keep UIManager.js as the root controller that instantiates and updates these components.
	2.	DebugManager.js
	•	Extract debug overlay or controls into their own file if applicable.
	3.	Optionally begin breaking up PhysicsManager.js if its responsibilities are starting to sprawl (e.g., group collision helpers, world init, and ball updates separately).

⸻

Phase 3: Ad System Optimization

Goals:
	•	Reduce performance impact from per-frame logic.
	•	Future-proof for scaling the number of ad ships.

Steps:
	1.	Profile AdShipManager.update() and look for opportunities to:
	•	Short-circuit distance checks if ships are clearly outside range.
	•	Possibly add a shouldUpdate() method or visibleRegionCheck() for ships.
	2.	Document current limits (e.g., max 4 ships) in a comment or config to explain performance assumptions.
	3.	If planning expansion: explore simple spatial partitioning (e.g., grid sectors) to avoid O(n²) comparisons.

⸻

Phase 4: Documentation & Developer Experience

Goals:
	•	Improve onboarding for new devs.
	•	Clarify subsystem interactions.

Steps:
	1.	Add/update DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md (or create ARCHITECTURE.md) to include:
	•	Overview of each major system (AdShip, CameraController, HoleEntity, etc.)
	•	Where each class hooks into the game flow (scene graph, update loop, event system)
	•	Basic diagram or bullet flow of game startup → hole transition → gameplay loop
	2.	Document the current status of NineHoleCourse, noting if any hole geometries are stubbed or incomplete.

⸻

Phase 5: Naming & Structural Consistency

Goals:
	•	Ensure clarity and naming alignment across files.

Steps:
	1.	Review objects/ and managers/:
	•	Ensure all manager classes end in Manager
	•	Check if HoleEntity vs BasicCourse vs NineHoleCourse need clarification or minor renaming to reflect their use
	2.	Standardize file naming and case style across all new modules (e.g., AdShipManager.js, HoleTransitionManager.js).

⸻

Phase 6 (Optional): Tests & Cleanup Automation

Goals:
	•	Prevent regressions in code structure and quality.

Steps:
	1.	Add a basic linting script to package.json, if not already included:

eslint src/ --fix


	2.	Consider a basic pre-commit hook (e.g., using Husky) to auto-format or check for large diffs in large files.
	3.	Set up a scripts/docs folder to contain visual diagrams or onboarding content as you go.

⸻

✅ Final Outcome
	•	Codebase is leaner, easier to navigate, and better documented.
	•	Subsystems like UI and Ads are fully modular and scalable.
	•	Ready to support more gameplay expansion without adding friction or entropy.
