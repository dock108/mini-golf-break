# Changelog for Mini Golf Break

All notable changes to the Mini Golf Break project will be documented in this file.

## [0.1.0] - Initial Development Phase

### Project Setup
- Created basic project structure following modular JavaScript architecture
- Set up Webpack for bundling and build process
- Configured Three.js and Cannon-es physics engine
- Established initial HTML/CSS layout with responsive design

### Core Systems Development
- Implemented `PhysicsWorld` class for managing physics simulation with Cannon-es
- Created `Game` class as the main controller for game state and scene management
- Developed `Ball` class with physics integration and visual representation
- Built `Course` class for terrain, obstacles, and hole placement
- Added `InputController` for handling mouse/touch input for ball striking

### Physics Implementation
- Configured collision detection between ball, course elements, and holes
- Set up material properties for proper friction and rebound behavior
- Implemented gravity and physics timestep management
- Added sleepState detection for determining when the ball has stopped moving

### Gameplay Features
- Created drag-and-release mechanic for hitting the ball
- Implemented power indicator showing shot strength
- Added visual aim line showing shot trajectory
- Developed hole detection system for recognizing successful putts
- Implemented basic scoring system
- Created water hazard detection and penalty system
- Added system for tracking and respawning at last safe position

### Camera and Controls
- Implemented orbit camera controls using Three.js OrbitControls
- Created system to follow the ball while in motion
- Added camera positioning for optimal viewing angle during shots
- Implemented camera controls toggle during shot preparation

### Visual Elements
- Designed minimalist golf course with grass texture
- Created visual representations for holes, flags, and obstacles
- Implemented shadows and lighting for better visual appeal
- Added power indicator and directional guide for shot feedback

### Bug Fixes and Refinements
- Fixed issues with hole collision detection
- Resolved camera movement conflicts during drag action
- Fixed physics integration issues with the ball
- Improved ball and camera positioning logic
- Enhanced power indicator responsiveness
- Fixed direction calculation for intuitive shot control

### Development Tools
- Added debug mode toggle (press 'd' key) for development
- Implemented debug visualization of physics bodies
- Added console logging for tracking ball velocity and position
- Created utility functions for streamlined development

## [Pending Features]
- Mobile-specific touch controls optimization
- Additional course designs
- Enhanced visual effects for successful putts
- Sound effects for ball rolling and collisions
- Course completion and game progression logic
- Menu and settings interface
