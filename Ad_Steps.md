Here’s a detailed, step-by-step execution plan — incorporating your original architecture and the enhancements we discussed — to take your ad ship system from zero to MVP:

⸻

Mini Golf Break – Ad Ship System Plan (MVP)

⸻

Phase 1: File Structure & Base System Setup

✅ 1. Create Core Ad System Files
	•	src/ads/AdShipManager.js — centralized logic for spawning, updating, and managing all ad ships.
	•	src/ads/AdShip.js — class for a single ad ship instance, handles mesh creation, animation, and banner setup.
	•	src/ads/adConfig.js — initial mock ad inventory (array of { title, url, texturePath }).

✅ 2. Add Scene Hook
	•	Inside your main scene loader or GameManager.js, instantiate AdShipManager and add its group to the root scene.
	•	scene.add(adShipManager.group);

⸻

Phase 2: Ad Ship Mesh + Banner Implementation

1. Create Placeholder Ship Meshes
	•	Create simple mock models for:
	•	NASAStyleShip – box or capsule with a wing.
	•	AlienCraft – saucer with lights.
	•	SpaceStation – ring or tube with rotating parts.
	•	Use low-poly BoxGeometry, CylinderGeometry, or load .glb later.

2. Attach LED Banner Planes
	•	Top or side PlaneGeometry mesh.
	•	Use MeshBasicMaterial with transparent: true and map set to loaded texture or canvas-generated ad banner.
	•	Bonus: use EmissiveMaterial or pulsing shader for glow effects later.

3. Implement Ad Texture Loader
	•	In AdShipManager, load textures for each ad (can be static images or canvas-generated with text).
	•	Assign to banner mesh in each AdShip.

⸻

Phase 3: Movement & Visibility

1. Place Ships Beneath the Course
	•	When spawning, place ships at y = -10 or similar.
	•	Animate ships slowly moving across screen (x or z), or orbiting under the green using sin/cos curves.
	•	Despawn (or recycle) when they leave bounds.

2. Add Visibility Awareness
	•	Have ships spawn at a predictable interval per hole (e.g., 1 per 30 seconds or on idle).
	•	Optionally:
	•	Flash subtle glow from below.
	•	Trigger camera nudge or alternate “spectator view” after 5 seconds idle to pan down and highlight them.

⸻

Phase 4: Interaction Handling

1. Create Interaction Layer (Optional MVP)
	•	Add raycaster targeting only banner surfaces.
	•	On mouseup, check if GameState === "AdInspecting" or similar.
	•	If so, test raycast hit and open ad.url in a new tab.

2. Fallback MVP Interaction
	•	For MVP, skip raycasting and instead show a HUD button like:
	•	“Sponsored by: Watch Mostly Sports” → on-click opens URL.
	•	This avoids blocking on input conflicts and lets you test UX first.

⸻

Phase 5: Performance Considerations

1. Lightweight Models
	•	Keep geometry simple.
	•	Avoid per-frame texture changes — preload all assets and re-use.

2. Ship Culling
	•	Remove/recycle ships once offscreen.
	•	Optional: basic visibility checking using camera frustum or position.x/z bounds.

⸻

Phase 6: Ad Inventory + Rotation Logic

1. Setup Rotating Ad Queue
	•	adConfig.js stores 3–5 mock ads:

export const mockAds = [
  { title: "Watch Mostly Sports", url: "https://youtube.com/...", texture: "ads/mostly-sports.png" },
  { title: "Try Prompt Crafter", url: "https://promptcrafter.vercel.app", texture: "ads/prompt-crafter.png" },
  ...
];


	•	AdShipManager randomly or sequentially assigns ads to each ship instance.

⸻

Phase 7: Test & Tune

1. MVP Playtest
	•	Load into scene, verify:
	•	Ship path is visible
	•	Banner displays correctly
	•	Interaction (if enabled) works
	•	Check that ball physics/gameplay are not affected

2. Refine Timing + Spawn Rates
	•	Tune spawn intervals, path speed, and spacing so they’re noticeable but not distracting.

⸻

✅ Done = MVP

You should now see:
	•	Flying ad ships beneath the course
	•	Proper banners
	•	Optional links or HUD interactions
	•	Clean architecture ready for scaling with real ads
