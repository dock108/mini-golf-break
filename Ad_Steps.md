Here's a detailed, step-by-step execution plan — incorporating your original architecture and the enhancements we discussed — to take your ad ship system from zero to MVP:

⸻

Mini Golf Break – Ad Ship System Plan (MVP)

⸻

Phase 1: File Structure & Base System Setup

✅ 1. Create Core Ad System Files
	•	src/ads/AdShipManager.js — centralized logic for spawning, updating, and managing all ad ships.
	•	src/ads/AdShip.js — class for a single ad ship instance, handles mesh creation, animation, and banner setup.
	•	src/ads/adConfig.js — initial mock ad inventory (array of { title, url, texturePath }).

✅ 2. Add Scene Hook
	•	Inside your main scene loader or GameManager.js, instantiate AdShipManager and add its group to the root scene.
	•	scene.add(adShipManager.group);

⸻

Phase 2: Ad Ship Mesh + Banner Implementation

✅ 3. Create Placeholder Ship Meshes
	•	Create simple mock models for:
	•	NASAStyleShip – box or capsule with a wing.
	•	AlienCraft – saucer with lights.
	•	SpaceStation – ring or tube with rotating parts.
	•	Use low-poly BoxGeometry, CylinderGeometry, or load .glb later.

✅ 4. Attach LED Banner Planes
	•	Top or side PlaneGeometry mesh.
	•	Use MeshBasicMaterial with transparent: true and map set to loaded texture or canvas-generated ad banner.
	•	Bonus: use EmissiveMaterial or pulsing shader for glow effects later.

✅ 5. Implement Ad Texture Loader / Generator
	•	AdShip generates canvas textures for banners based on `adData.title`.
	•	Manager assigns ads to banner mesh in each AdShip during recycling/updates.

⸻

Phase 3: Movement & Visibility

✅ 6. Place Ships Beneath the Course & Animate
	•	Ships positioned at varying `verticalOffset` levels (e.g., y = -15 to -25).
	•	'station' types orbit the center.
    •   'nasa'/'alien' types fly linearly across the area and recycle.
	•	Ships are scaled for visibility.

✅ 7. Add Visibility Awareness
	•	Ship presence maintained via recycling (linear) or continuous orbit (station).
	•	Optional:
	•	Flash subtle glow from below. (Not Implemented)
	•	Camera subtly blends target towards nearest ad ship during ball motion.

⸻

Phase 4: Interaction Handling

1. Create Interaction Layer (Optional MVP)
	•	Add raycaster targeting only banner surfaces.
	•	On mouseup, check if GameState === "AdInspecting" or similar.
	•	If so, test raycast hit and open ad.url in a new tab.

2. Fallback MVP Interaction
	•	For MVP, skip raycasting and instead show a HUD button like:
	•	"Sponsored by: Watch Mostly Sports" → on-click opens URL.
	•	This avoids blocking on input conflicts and lets you test UX first.

⸻

Phase 5: Performance Considerations

✅ 10. Lightweight Models
	•	Keep geometry simple. (Using procedural placeholders)
	•	Avoid per-frame texture changes — preload all assets and re-use. (Using canvas generation on change)

✅ 11. Ship Culling / Recycling
	•	Linear ships recycle when offscreen.
    •   Orbiting ships stay within defined radii.
	•	Optional: basic visibility checking using camera frustum or position.x/z bounds.

⸻

Phase 6: Ad Inventory + Rotation Logic

✅ 12. Setup Rotating Ad Queue
	•	adConfig.js stores 3–5 mock ads:

export const mockAds = [
  { title: "Watch Mostly Sports", url: "https://youtube.com/...", texture: "ads/mostly-sports.png" },
  { title: "Try Prompt Crafter", url: "https://promptcrafter.vercel.app", texture: "ads/prompt-crafter.png" },
  ...
];

	•	AdShipManager randomly or sequentially assigns ads to each ship instance via recycling (linear) or timer (both).

⸻

Phase 7: Test & Tune

1. MVP Playtest
	•	Load into scene, verify:
	•	Ship path is visible
	•	Banner displays correctly
	•	Interaction (if enabled) works
	•	Check that ball physics/gameplay are not affected

2. Refine Timing + Spawn Rates
	•	Tune spawn intervals, path speed, and spacing so they're noticeable but not distracting.

⸻

✅ Done = MVP

You should now see:
	•	Flying ad ships beneath the course
	•	Proper banners
	•	Optional links or HUD interactions
	•	Clean architecture ready for scaling with real ads
